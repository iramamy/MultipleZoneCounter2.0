# Multiple Zone Counter 2.0

Multiple Zone Counter 2.0 is an advanced version of the [MultipleZoneCounter](https://github.com/iramamy/MultipleZoneCounter). This tool leverages OpenCV's powerful capabilities for drawing regions of interest and integrates YOLOv8 for efficient tracking and counting within these regions.

## Features

- **Region Drawing with OpenCV**: Utilize OpenCV to draw custom polygonal regions directly on video frames, providing flexibility and precision in defining areas of interest.
- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Employ YOLOv8 for robust object detection, tracking, and counting within the defined regions.
- **Dynamic Region Management**: Easily move and adjust regions on the fly, ensuring accurate tracking and counting even in dynamic environments.
- **Real-time Processing**: Perform real-time object detection, tracking, and counting, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate feedback.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- Shapely
- Numpy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iramamy/MultipleZoneCounter2.0
    cd MultipleZoneCounter2.0
    ```
2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
### Usage
1. Run the main script with the desired parameters:

    ```bash
    python yolo_counter.py
    ```

2. Use the mouse to draw polygonal regions on the first frame of the video. Press `p` to proceed to video playback.

3. During playback, the defined regions will dynamically track and count objects using YOLOv8.

### Keyboard Controls

- **Left Mouse Button**: Draw points for the polygonal region.
- **Enter**: Finish drawing the current region.
- **R**: Remove the last drawn point.
- **S**: Save all drawn regions and switch to playback mode.
- **P**: Pause and resume playback.
- **Q**: Quit the application.
